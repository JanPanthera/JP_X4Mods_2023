#TradeSubscriptionExplorer

v2.0.0
~ Initial release of the new TradeSubscriptionExplorer

v2.0.1 -- Current Published version
~ Added: A translation for IdleReturnHome.
~ Changed: Modified the sector sorting process from a mix of distance and jump count checks to the usage of estimate_travel_time.
~ Changed: Enhanced script execution speed by altering wait segments from 1000ms to 1ms.
~ Optimized: The TradeSubscriptionExplorer fleet management is now more streamlined and stable, thanks to the utilization of in-game functionality.
~ Optimized: Generic code optimizations have been carried out for improved performance.

v2.0.2 -- Current Development version
~ Added: The script now calcualtes a path to the target sector and subsequently runs the 'move.generic' command for every gate/highway in the path.
~ Fixed: Resolved an issue where the ship was sometimes unable to reach a sector or would halt after a jump.
~ Fixed: German translation of 'Werft' is now 'Raumdock'.
~ Fixed: The internal blacklist was being cleared when the script was reloaded. This caused the ship to forget which sector it was working in. 
         Given the sorting process via estimate_time, the ship might choose to go to another sector even though it had work remaining in its current sector.
