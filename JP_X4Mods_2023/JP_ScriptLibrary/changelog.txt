#ScriptLibrary

v1.0.0
~ Initial release

v1.0.1
~ Added: jp.lib.FindStationToEquipAt.xml
~ Added: Some often used translations.
~ Fixed: The 'IdleReturnHome' feature was not functioning when no option was selected. It now defaults to 'Idle: Move to?' using either the position and sector stored in their settings or the position and sector where the ship initiated the script.
~ Fixed: The script that cancels the Idle task now removes only the orders generated by the Idle order itself.
~ Fixed: The 'Find Station' function now performs a search for stations only when enabled.
~ Changed: The 'Find Station' function now organizes its findings by estimated travel time.
~ Changed: "jp.lib.Restock" is now "jp.lib.RestockEquipment," with some improvements to its logic.
~ Updated: Several minor enhancements have been made to the code and translations.

v1.0.2 -- Current Published Version
~ Added: jp.lib.ConvertARGBtoHex.xml
~ Added: jp.lib.GetFactionColorCode.xml
~ Added: jp.lib.GetFactionRelationColorCode.xml
~ Added: A variable has been added to store the ship's initial position/sector when the script is activated. This ensures that the ship will return to its starting position/sector when no Idle option is selected. This addition also needs to be implemented in each script that utilizes IdleReturnHome.

v1.0.3 -- Current Development Version
~ Added: Czech translations
~ Added: jp.lib.MoveToPosition.xml - Simple implementation of the MoveToPosition to get the ability to change parameters like "uselocalhighway" or "traveldrive".
~ Added: jp.lib.RestockDeployables.xml - This function limits the number of deployables that a ship can store before swapping them out, sells existing deployables to create room for new ones, or it can be used exclusively for selling deployables.
~ Updated: jp.lib.MoveToSector.xml - S and M ships now correctly utilize the Ring Highway. L and XL ships currently use the Gates by flying through them, similar to the way S and M ships do.
~ Updated: jp.lib.SortByEstimatedTravelTime.xml - when the input is a list of Sectors, the sector where we currently are will always be prioritized and placed first in the list.
~ Updated: Several code cleanup and translations changes.
