#AnotherExplorer

v1.0.1
~ Added: Now, when the ship enters the idle state, 'Idle' will be appended to the ship's name.
~ Added: If you change a setting of the Sector or Galaxy script, it will now clear the orders list.
~ Added: I have included a description for the sector and galaxy order script, which will be visible when you hover over it.
~ Updated: Lowered the experience gain.
~ Updated: Enhanced the description of the mod in the extension menu.
~ Updated: Improved Russian language translation, thanks to alexalsp.
~ Changed: I've relocated the section of the code that removes the OrderTag from the name to the cleanup section.

v1.0.1
~ Fixed: Description of the Sector version

v1.0.2
~ Fixed: Addressed the issue where the script was incorrectly using the translation files from SatelliteDropper, causing a "ReadText" error.

v1.0.3
~ Added: A translation for IdleReturnHome.
~ Fixed: The "Find a Station?" option couldn't be saved.
~ Changed: Modified the sector sorting process from a mix of distance and jump count checks to the usage of estimate_travel_time.
~ Changed: Enhanced script execution speed by altering wait segments from 1000ms to 1ms.
~ Updated: Improved the Russian translation, thanks to alexalsp.
~ Optimized: The AnotherExplorer fleet management is now more streamlined and stable, thanks to the utilization of in-game functionality.
~ Optimized: Generic code optimizations have been carried out for improved performance.

v1.0.4
~ Added: Implemented a check to clear the internal blacklist of ships that have been destroyed.
~ Added: The script now calcualtes a path to the target sector and subsequently runs the 'move.generic' command for every gate/highway in the path.
~ Fixed: Resolved an issue where the ship was sometimes unable to reach a sector or would halt after a jump.
~ Fixed: German translation of 'Werft' is now 'Raumdock'.
~ Fixed: The internal blacklist was being cleared when the script was reloaded. This caused the ship to forget which sector it was working in. 
         Given the sorting process via estimate_time, the ship might choose to go to another sector even though it had work remaining in its current sector.
~ Changed: The script now calculates its own safe position instead of using the 'get_safe_pos' command from Egosoft, which hasn't been working properly in some cases.

v1.0.5
~ Added: A option to also uncover construction sites.
~ Added: A option to ignore ownerless sectors.
~ Added: The mod now utilizes the JP_ScriptLibrary for some functions, reducing code volume and streamlining the addition and fixing of code.
~ Added: Option to enable/disable notifications and logging in logbook.
~ Updated: Some minor code and translation changes.

v1.0.6 -- Current Published Version
~ Added: Message and logbook entry when the ship has uncovered an Object. (Optional)
~ Added: A variable has been added to store the ship's initial position/sector when the script is activated. This ensures that the ship will return to its starting position/sector when no Idle option is selected.
~ Fixed: "Construction Sites?" and "Ownerless Sectors?" parameter of fleet subordinates were not inherited from the leader.
~ Updated: Some minor code and translation changes.

v1.0.7 -- Current Development Version
