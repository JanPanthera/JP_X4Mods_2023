#DataVaultExplorer

v2.0.0
~ Initial re-release

v2.0.1 -- Current Published version
~ Added: Added a "home position" parameter where the ship will move to when it has marked all data vaults or when it can't reach any more due to a blacklist.
~ Added: The script now calcualtes a path to the target sector and subsequently runs the 'move.generic' command for every gate/highway in the path.
~ Fixed: Resolved an issue where the ship was sometimes unable to reach a sector or would halt after a jump.
~ Changed: The script now calculates its own safe position instead of using the 'get_safe_pos' command from Egosoft, which hasn't been working properly in some cases.
