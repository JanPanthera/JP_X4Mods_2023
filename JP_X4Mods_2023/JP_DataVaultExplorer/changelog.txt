#DataVaultExplorer

v2.0.0
~ Initial re-release

v2.0.1 -- Current Published Version
~ Added: Added a "home position" parameter where the ship will move to when it has marked all data vaults or when it can't reach any more due to a blacklist.
~ Added: The script now calcualtes a path to the target sector and subsequently runs the 'move.generic' command for every gate/highway in the path.
~ Fixed: Resolved an issue where the ship was sometimes unable to reach a sector or would halt after a jump.
~ Changed: The script now calculates its own safe position instead of using the 'get_safe_pos' command from Egosoft, which hasn't been working properly in some cases.

v2.0.2 -- Current Development Version
~ Added: Option to enable/disable notifications and logging in logbook.
~ Fixed: There was an issue with the function that checks whether a station has enough resources to build all the necessary navigation beacons.
         This issue caused the ship to dock and wait for resources, potentially for an extended period of time, depending on when the station was resupplied with resources.
~ Updated: Some minor code and translation changes.
